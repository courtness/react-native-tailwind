  React Native / Tailwind Starter

## ⚡️ Quick start

1. **Install**

   Install the dependencies as normal with yarn:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

2. **(Optional) Clean**

   You can remove build folders with:

   ```
   yarn clean:android
   yarn clean:ios
   ```

   This will clear watchman and remove the metro tmp dir:

   ```
   yarn clean:metro
   ```

   This will do all of the above:

   ```
   yarn clean
   ```

3. **Serve**

   The default start command will leave Metro running:

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

   Or to start with a cache reset, use:

   ```
   yarn start:reset
   ```

4. **Simulate**

   With metro running in a separate terminal, you can run the simulators:

   ```
   yarn run:android
   yarn run:ios
   ```
